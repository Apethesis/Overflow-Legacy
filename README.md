# Overflow

#What is Overflow?
Overflow is a open sourced exploit. This isn't really a exploit at the minute more of it is just using the We Are Devs DLL. The next majour update wil be

# UI Redisign
After that it will be
# DLL Switcher
Then it will be
# Custom DLL

# But why is Custom DLL such a low priority?
I fucking hate C++ :D
