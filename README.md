# Overflow-Legacy
Just an old version of Overflow now, still works but isn't good.
Project moved to [here](https://github.com/Stealthr/Overflow).
The end....?

## What is Overflow?
Overflow is a open sourced exploit. This isn't really a exploit at the minute more of it is just using the WeAreDevs DLL (skiddish, i know).
